# IPYNB_Json_Example
Per [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65946583/json-styling-in-jupyter-lab-and-github), currently the GitHub web app does not render Jupyer's built-in JSON viewer. Instead, it is displayed as the text `<IPython.core.display.JSON object>`

## Contents of this repo
1. `example.ipynb` - Notebook which demonstrates the issue. Load it up in the web viewer, and you will see the cell's output.
2. `locally_hosted_jupyter_result.png` - File which shows how the JSON viewer is intended to look, via a locally-hosted Jupyter notebook.
